                        There will come soft rain and the smell of the ground,<br>
                        And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;<br>
                        And frogs in the pools singing at night,<br>
                        And wild plum trees in tremulous white;<br>
                        Robins will wear their feathery fire,<br>
                        Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;<br>
                        And not one will know of the war, not one<br>
                        Will care at last when it is done.<br>
                        Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,<br>
                        If mankind perished utterly;<br>
                        And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn<br>
                        Would scarcely know that we were gone.

                    <p class="poem-author">by William Shakespeare</p>
                    <p class="poem">
                        Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
                        Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br>
                        Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
                        And summer's lease hath all too short a date.<br>
                        Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
                        And often is his gold complexion dimmed;<br>
                        And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
                        By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimmed;<br>
                        But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
                        Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,<br>
                        Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,<br>
                        When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.<br>
                        So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br>
                        So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

                    <p class="poem-author">by Walt Whitman</p>
                    <p class="poem">
                        O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;<br>
                        The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won;<br>
                        The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br>
                        While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:<br>
                        But O heart! heart! heart!<br>
                        O the bleeding drops of red,<br>
                        Where on the deck my Captain lies,<br>
                        Fallen cold and dead.<br>
                        O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;<br>
                        Rise up — for you the flag is flung — for you the bugle trills;<br>
                        For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths — for you the shores a-crowding;<br>
                        For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;<br>
                        Here Captain! dear father!<br>
                        This arm beneath your head;<br>
                        It is some dream that on the deck,<br>
                        You've fallen cold and dead.<br>
                        My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;<br>
                        My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;<br>
                        The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;<br>
                        From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won; 20<br>
                        Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!<br>
                        But I, with mournful tread,<br>
                        Walk the deck my Cptain lies,<br>
                        Fallen cold and dead.

                    <p class="poem-author">by Rudyard Kipling</p>
                    <p class="poem">
                        If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
                        Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;<br>
                        If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
                        But make allowance for their doubting too:<br>
                        If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
                        Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br>
                        Or being hated don't give way to hating,<br>
                        And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;<br>
                        If you can dream- -and not make dreams your master;<br>
                        If you can think- -and not make thoughts your aim,<br>
                        If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
                        And treat those two impostors just the same:.<br>
                        If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br>
                        Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
                        Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
                        And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools;<br>
                        If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
                        And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
                        And lose, and start again at your beginnings,<br>
                        And never breathe a word about your loss:<br>
                        If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
                        To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
                        And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
                        Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on! "<br>
                        If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
                        Or walk with Kings- -nor lose the common touch,<br>
                        If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
                        If all men count with you, but none too much:<br>
                        If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
                        With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,<br>
                        Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br>
                        And- -which is more- -you'll be a Man, my son!
